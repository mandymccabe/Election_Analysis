# Election_Analysis
## Overview
Data from a U.S. congressional election in Colorado was collected and needed analaysis.  The data is generally analyzed in Microsoft Excel but the board is looking into the possibility of automating the process with Python.  If successful, the code may be used in other election audits.   

The data was pulled from the following CSV file: [LINK](Challenge\election_results.csv).

## Election Audit Results
Using Python the team was able to the extract data and analyze it in a variety of ways including:
- the winning cadidate
- which candidates received votes and their respective percentages
- the county with the best voter turnout
- total votes cast  
The image below shows election result output after the completed script was ran:

## Election Audit Summary
The script used for analyzing this data may be used in to help automate the analysis of other elections.  If used, the data from other elections would need to be in the same format as what was used in this election.  If not exactly the same, the script would need to be modified to reference the correct indexes within the new data.  Additionally, depending on the type of election, the output verbiage would also need to be updated to accurately reflect the election.  If additional columns of data we collected additional script could be written to help create voter profiles like percentage of male vs. female voter, voter age, and relate that info to the candiate they voted for.
